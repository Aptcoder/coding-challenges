# Coding-Challenges

My attempts at completing the coding challenges. Refer to them as attempts (not solutions) as the code written is more for the purpose of me hacking/figuring out a way that works as opposed to building a optimal solution.

For now, I approach the challenges using Python; soon, I may use Go or Javascript.
